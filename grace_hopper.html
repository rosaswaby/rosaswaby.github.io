  <h1> Grace Hopper 2016 </h1>
  <p> If you are on this page, then I have applied for your scholarship to attend Grace Hopper 2016 </p>
  <p> As a computer science major at NYU, I am really interested in graphic design and web development and
    I decided to make a Grace Hopper animation. It was so much fun to make and I hope to build on it to hopefully present a Grace Hopper this year.
    Check it out below! </p>
