        <li> NYU Body Labs Hackathon 2015 Winner - An app that serves as your personal dance teacher, supplementing the in-class experience. We  envisioned the workflow of the app as 1) choose the dance step you want to learn/improve, 2) view your animated body model demonstrating how you currently perform the step, 3) receive corrections on how to improve your technique, and then 4) see your body model correctly doing the step.Applications for this technology exist beyond dance â€” for example, the app can be adapted for the instruction of yoga or martial arts. Here is a <a href = "BodyLabs.pdf" class = "personal_links"> MockUp </a> of our app.
